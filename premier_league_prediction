Project Goal
Predict the top 5 teams most likely to win the league in the current season using historical match data and machine learning.

Model Approach
1. Data Preprocessing
Convert Date to datetime

Extract HomeWin as target variable (1 if home team wins)

Handle missing values

2. Feature Engineering
Team Form (last 5 matches)

Average Goals Scored/Conceded

Betting odds data

3. Model Used
Algorithm: RandomForestClassifier (scikit-learn)

Features: Team form, goal averages, odds

Target: HomeWin (binary)

4. Prediction Method
Calculate expected points for each team

Rank teams by total expected points

Expected Output
text
Predicted Top 5 Teams:
1. Manchester City - 78.5 pts
2. Liverpool - 75.2 pts
3. Arsenal - 70.8 pts
4. Chelsea - 68.1 pts
5. Tottenham - 65.3 pts
